Learning the tutorial about GitHub
I was told to write a little about myself from the tutorial

I am a 25 year old male currently working a job I dislike and am learning front and back end web development
I am learning at work and at home so I figured from waht I've heard and read about GitHub that it was
a good choice to store my projects/files as I'm learning so I can access them at work, at home
or on my phone.
